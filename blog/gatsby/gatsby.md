I just followed Andrew Mead's [Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM) and now I have a blog.

Andrew Mead is a Udemy teacher who makes Web Development courses. His Gatsby Bootcamp got me started with a basic blog using the following technologies:

1. [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
2. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
3. [React](https://reactjs.org)
4. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

I intend to use the blog to write succinct articles about learning, web development, and computer science. Here are some articles I intend to write, I will try to remember to link them once they are written:

- [an introduction to the JAM Stack](/blog/jamstack)
- [a write up on how this very blog was developed](/blog/blog)
- [deploying Meteor to heroku](/blog/meteor-heroku)
- Meteor mobile app dev/publishing
- Meteor S3 Storage w/ Slingshot
- Express + GraphQL API
- Rails + GraphQL API
- HTTPS on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- making a site PWA ready
- Serial/Parallel extreme web scraping
- Learning Prisma
