# jist.dev

My personal site for blog posts and projects.

### develop

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jistjoalal/jist.dev.git
cd blog
npm install
npm run develop  # runs @ localhost:8000
```

## dev notes / todos

- post tags (possible in markdown?)
- generate table of contents for each post
- improve PostTitle and ProjectTitle components (img, description, etc.)
- mouse interaction w/ animation
- need to find better way of switching themes
